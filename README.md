## 📖 Overview
DriveSmart is a web application that helps siblings (or anyone sharing a car) decide **who should take the car** on a given day. It calculates the most cost-effective option by considering:  
- 👥 Number of passengers per sibling  
- 💵 Passenger charges (round-trip earnings)  
- ⛽ Fuel costs (based on distance, mileage, and fuel price)  
- 📉 Depreciation (resale value loss per km driven)  
- 🔄 Reverse ride costs (when not driving)  

The app provides clear recommendations and detailed calculation breakdowns for all scenarios:  
- ✅ Sibling A drives
